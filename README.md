# Zuitt Bootcamp Files

This repository contains all the files, exercises, and projects completed during my time at Zuitt Bootcamp.  
The files cover different topics across the bootcamp curriculum, including:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** basics
- **Frontend projects** and user interface designs
- **Backend development** fucosing in API's
- **Capstone projects** and major assignments
- **Mini-projects** and coding exercises to practice skills

These files demonstrate the learning journey, technical skills, and hands-on experiences I gained throughout the bootcamp.
